	<h1>The Battle Must Be Fought On All Fronts</h1>
	<h3>An visualization of activist movements on Twitter</h3>
</div>

<div id="main">

	<p>In his first 100 days in office President Trump has made an unprecedented number of legislative action attacking historically progressive causes seemingly across the board. As many have commented, the effect is overwhelming. With so many rights in danger, so many people's lives affected, and so much at risk, how do we fight back? </p>

	<p>The phrase that keeps returning to my mind is that the battle must be fought on all fronts. It’s not enough for one cause or person to be protected, we must be vigilant in all areas threatened by sweeping new policies. But what does that looks like? How does one stay vigilant on all fronts, much less defend all fronts? How does one know what battles are being fought, and when?</p>

	<p>This project is a visualization of collective attention for progressive causes in the Twittersphere. In this case, social media functions as a microcosm through which to measure the global public’s attention.  I’ve taken the most popular hashtag  from twelve historically liberal causes and found their average unique tweets per day, calculated for the week of March 4th through 10th.  Each concentric circle represents on hundred unique tweets that use the given hashtag. Therefore the largest causes represent the causes with the most attention for the given week.</p>

	<p>When viewed as a whole, the graphic is meant to graphically represent the cultural war taking place on Twitter. With a single glance, one can see which “battles” are being fought right now, and just how popular they are. It’s also a way of escaping one’s own filter bubble in order to make quantitative sense of which causes are more publicly accessible, mainstream, and socially accepted. It has been a practice in understanding the proportionality of cause-specific popularity.</p>
